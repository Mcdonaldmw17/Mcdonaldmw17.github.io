         <div class="content">Welcome to C.A.I. (Climate Action Information). Here you can find useful information about what is happening to our planet and how you can help. You can contact us with the contact feature above. If you have any issues or queries about the information or our website, please contact us. We hope to change the browsers lifestyle choices and perception of what Climate Change and Action is. Overall educating everyone on how Climate Change is not actually a myth, unlike Donald J. Trump (Current President of the U.S.A.) who quoted, "I don't believe it." Also, " The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." Enjoy exploring our website. </div>
