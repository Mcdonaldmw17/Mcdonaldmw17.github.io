        For over 150 years industrial countries have been burning fossil fuels such as, oil, coal, natural gases, oil, and others. These fossil fuels and the mining of them, are releasing gases up into the atmopshere. These gases are trapping heat inside our Earth from the sun, causing our planet to heat up and cause Global Warming. This is known as the 'Greenhouse Effect'. Other ways of releasing greenhouse gases include, farming, deforestaion, factories, and others.

         <div class="content">Global warming is the increase of earthâ€™s average temperature and its oceans. This is due to greenhouse gases being released into the atmopshere. Global warming causes extreme environmental conditions on Earth. These include, wild fires seen in Australia, colder winters and hotter summers, ice melting in places such as Antarctica, and many other issues. Global warming has emerged as one of the biggest environmental issues in the last two decades.</div>
